This project does not require any backendservers, for the best expericance, I suggest using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) and cloning the repo into the Apache Server directory at `C:\xampp\htdocs` (for windows) and set the port to something like 8080 and open up a browser and point to `localhost:8080`
